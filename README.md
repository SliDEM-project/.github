Assessing the suitability of DEMs derived from Sentinel-1 for landslide volume estimation.

## Goal
The overall goal of SliDEM is to assess the potential for determining landslide volumes based on digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data.
Therefore, we will develop a low-cost, transferable, semi-automated method implemented within a Python package based on open-source tools. 
SliDEM will analyse the technical challenges related to radar interferometry within mountainous, landslide-prone regions in Austria and Norway. 
We will assess and validate the quality of the DEM results in comparison to reference elevation data, 
and evaluate the proposed workflow in terms of reliability, performance, reproducibility, and transferability. 
SliDEM will contribute significantly to increasing our knowledge about the applicability of Sentinel-1 DEMs for natural hazards research, 
in particular for landslide assessment.
